                    <p>
                        My name is Tate Wilhelm and I'm a programmer and photographer from Vienna, Virginia. 
                        I am passionate about creating things, whether that is creating programming projects,
                        woodworking, making videos and taking pictures, or building a dope castle in Minecraft.
                        I'm currently living in Blacksburg, VA and am a senior at Virginia Tech majoring in 
                        Business Information Technology with a minor in Computer Science. After graduation, I'll be 
                        moving back to NoVA, where I'll join GEICO as a Software Engineer. I throughly enjoy just 
                        about any outdoor activity, but I love snow skiing most of all. When I can't shred the gnar 
                        (which is most of the time unfortunately) I love exploring the great hiking trails in the 
                        New River Valley, off-roading in my family's Jeeps, playing catch, or just taking a walk.

                        I created this website for fun as a place to showcase some of my work, as well as 
                        try my hand at developing and hosting my own website from scratch.
